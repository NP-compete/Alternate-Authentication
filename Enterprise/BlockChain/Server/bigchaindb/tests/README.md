# BigchainDB Server Unit Tests

Most of the tests in the `tests/` folder are unit tests. For info about how to write and run tests, see [the docs about contributing to BigchainDB](http://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/contributing/en/latest/index.html), especially:

- [Write Code - Remember to Write Tests](http://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/contributing/en/latest/dev-setup-coding-and-contribution-process/write-code.html#remember-to-write-tests)
- [Notes on Running a Local Dev Node with Docker Compose](http://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/contributing/en/latest/dev-setup-coding-and-contribution-process/run-node-with-docker-compose.html), especially `make test`

Note: There are acceptance tests in the `acceptance/` folder (at the same level in the hierarchy as the `tests/` folder).
