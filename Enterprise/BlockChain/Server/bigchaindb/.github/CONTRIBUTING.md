# How to Contribute to the BigchainDB Project

There are many ways you can contribute to the BigchainDB project, some very easy and others more involved.

All of that is documented elsewhere: go to the "[Contributing to BigchainDB" docs on ReadTheDocs](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/contributing/en/latest/index.html).

Note: GitHub automatically links to this file (`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`) when a contributor creates a new issue or pull request, so you shouldn't delete it. Just use it to point people to full and proper help elsewhere.
