# Production Node Assumptions

Be sure you know the key BigchainDB terminology:

* [BigchainDB node, BigchainDB network and BigchainDB consortium](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/terminology.html)
* [dev/test node, bare-bones node and production node](../introduction)

We make some assumptions about production nodes:

1. Each production node is set up and managed by an experienced professional system administrator or a team of them.
1. Each production node in a network is managed by a different person or team.
