# Production-Ready?

Depending on your use case, BigchainDB may or may not be production-ready. You should ask your service provider.
If you want to go live (into production) with BigchainDB, please consult with your service provider.

Note: BigchainDB has an open source license with a "no warranty" section that is typical of open source licenses. This is standard in the software industry. For example, the Linux kernel is used in production by billions of machines even though its license includes a "no warranty" section. Warranties are usually provided above the level of the software license, by service providers.
