# Alternative to traditional credential based authentication

**Organization:**      KG Info System Pvt. Ltd

**Category:**          Software

**Technology Bucket:** Software - Web App Development

**Problem Code:**      RV3

## Initial Idea:

Implementing a new system induces high cost for any organization. So our solution upgrades the existing
system instead of replacing it. We propose a blockchain powered decentralized, serverless, and secure approach built on top of the existing system of username and password.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
