# Alternative to traditional credential based authentication

**Organization:**      KG Info System Pvt. Ltd

**Category:**          Software

**Technology Bucket:** Software - Web App Development

**Problem Code:**      RV3

## Initial Idea:

Implementing a new system induces high cost for any organization. So our solution upgrades the existing
system instead of replacing it. We propose a blockchain powered decentralized, serverless, and secure approach built on top of the existing system of username and password.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
npm install
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

chrome->setting->extension->Load unpacked

git clone

git clone

run server

cd Alt/app/desk/back/
node server.js

Activate the extension

Activate by clicking the extension icon, <u r connected>
  
  
Visit any website and login to drive

For enterprise

start bigchaindb

For desktop app 

cd alt/appln/DeSKTOP/
npm start

otp login
change security level

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
