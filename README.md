# Alternative to traditional credential based authentication

**Organization:**      KG Info System Pvt. Ltd

**Category:**          Software

## Working Demo

A working demo can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF3bruNefgk&feature=youtu.be)

## Initial Idea:

Implementing a new system induces high cost for any organization. So our solution upgrades the existing
system instead of replacing it. We propose a blockchain powered decentralized, and secure approach built on top of the existing system of username and password.
